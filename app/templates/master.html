    <p>Disaster response is one of the most important problems that we're trying to solve in Data Science and Machine
        Learning right now.</p>

    <p>In the wake of a disaster there are millions of communications either direct or via social media, right at the
        time when disaster response organizations have the least capacity to filter and pull out the messages which are
        the most important. Furthermore, only one in every thousand messages is actually relevant to the disaster
        response professionals, according to Robert Munro, former CTO of Figure Eight (now Appen).</p>

    <h3>Machine learning to the rescue</h3>

    <p>Disasters are typically responded to by different organizations that take care of different parts of the problem.
        So one organization will care about water, another will care about blocked roads, another will care about
        medical supplies. But sorting through help requests by keywords only is ineffective. For example, when you look
        at a keyword like "water", that's actually a very small percent of the time that it will map to someone who
        needs fresh drinking wate. Moreover, that will miss miss people who say they're thirsty, but don't use the word
        "water."</p>

    <p>Thanks to Figure Eight's effort of combining messages from several real-life distasters and consistently labeling
        them, we can train a supervised machine learning model and ensure that each organization gets relevant help
        requests.</p>
